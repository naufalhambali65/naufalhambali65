### Hello Guys ðŸ‘‹

Hi! My name is Naufal Syafiq Hambali.\
I am an aspiring Backend Web Developer actively seeking opportunities to grow and gain experience in the field of Information Technology, especially in web development. With a strong foundation in PHP and TypeScript, and practical knowledge in using frameworks like Laravel and Express.js, I am passionate about creating efficient, secure, and scalable web applications.

I am eager to learn from real-world challenges and contribute meaningfully to collaborative development teams. I have experience building RESTful APIs, managing databases (MySQL, MongoDB), and applying clean coding practices. My academic background in Computer Science has equipped me with solid problem-solving and analytical skills.

Iâ€™m currently looking for full-time, internship, or project-based opportunities to sharpen my skills and gain hands-on experience.
